## In Detail Resume Building Steps along with Explanation and Example:

### For ATF Friendly Resume

#### 1. **Follow the Job Description and Include Keywords**
   - **Explanation**: When you create a resume, start by reading the job description carefully. Identify the specific skills and requirements the employer is looking for, like "project management" or "Java programming." Include these **keywords** in your resume. This makes it easier for Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) to recognize you as a good match for the job.
   - **Example**: If the job is for a “Digital Marketing Specialist,” mention relevant terms like “SEO,” “Google Analytics,” or “content creation” if they fit your experience.

#### 2. **Avoid Including a Photo**
   - **Explanation**: Some companies use ATS software to sort and filter resumes. Photos can interfere with this process, so avoid adding them. Many companies also focus on skills and qualifications over appearance, so photos aren’t necessary.
   
#### 3. **Highlight Relevant Skills and Projects**
   - **Explanation**: Only include the skills and projects that directly match the job description. For example, if you’re applying for a web developer position, mention your experience with **JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and React** instead of unrelated skills.
   - **Tip**: Customize your resume for each application to match the specific job requirements.

#### 4. **Use Proper English and Check Grammar**
   - **Explanation**: Make sure your resume is free from grammar or spelling errors. Good language shows professionalism and attention to detail. Use tools like Grammarly if you need help.
   
#### 5. **Check Your Email Frequently**
   - **Explanation**: Recruiters may contact you by email for interview calls or updates. Regularly check your inbox and spam folder to avoid missing any important messages.

### Structure of a Great Resume

#### 1. **Contact Information**
   - **Explanation**: Start with your **name, degree, phone number, email, and any relevant profile links** (like LinkedIn or your portfolio). Make sure this information is easy to find.

#### 2. **Career Objective or Summary**
   - **Explanation**: Write a short summary of your career goals in 2-4 lines. It should explain who you are, what skills you bring, and what you’re looking for in a job.
